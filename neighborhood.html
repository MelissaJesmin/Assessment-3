            My neighborhood consists mainly of your ongoing corner deli that everyone knows of since their early childhood. Along with that it also comes with kids playing with their neighbors in such a compressed space, yet they manage to enjoy their time. And of course, you can’t forget about all the honking going around the streets from early in the morning to late evening, which by now we’re all accustomed to. My neighborhood isn’t too different from your casual New York neighborhood.
