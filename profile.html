            <p>
                Melissaâ€™s interest in computer science was piqued through Girls Who Code where she worked on projects in different coding languages and robots. Melissa worked as a Robotics specialist for the First Lego League. She led the program and supported students with coding and building their robots, as well as helping them think of research topics for innovation projects. She also worked as a college advisor at a high school and helped high school seniors decide their college or career plans. Although she enjoyed these jobs, Melissa wants to continue her journey as a software engineer. She wants to grow her skills in creating applications and hopes to polish her programming skills to set into a software engineering position after Hackbright.
